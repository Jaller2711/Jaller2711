				<p>Submarine-Mayhem is a 3rd year team project that we made from the theme 'Start with Nothing'. 
					We started working on the project in September and finished it at the start of December.
					Each member focus on a diffent part of the game to create it. Jaller2711 worked on making the player and enemies shoot as well as take damage, 
					Luke-Courtney worked on the movement for the player, IshkaY worked on the oxygen which acts as the players health and 0Cillian0 worked on 
					the pickups to name some of the things we made for our game.</p>
		
				<p>The story of the game is that you are trying to recover lost gems, you explore an underwater cave 
					system battling other submarines that are also looking for the gems. You control the yellow submarine 
					and you explore the cave while dogeing the spikes on the wall and the enemies shooting at you but your oxygen will slowly deplete over time 
					if you don't get to the gem in time.</p>
		
				<p>You move your submarine by pressing W, A, S and D, you can shoot by moving the mouse to where you want to shoot and left click the mouse to fire a bullet.
					When you kill an enemy it will drop a random pickup that will increase your speed, the bullets damage or give you oxygen back.
					There are 3 levels at the end of the levels is a gem and by colliding into it you go to the next level.</p>
